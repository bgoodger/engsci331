	This file is where you'll put the header information about the functions you write.  This is just 
	the argument list (as it is in the first line of your function declarations in myEigenFunctions.cpp)
	followed by a semi-colon.  Two example functions have been done for you.

====================================================================================================*/

double DotProduct(double **A, double **B, int n, int m);
double DotProduct(double *A, double *B, int n);

// Note that these two functions have the same name, but different argument lists.  This is called 
// "function overloading" and is allowed by C++ compilers.
